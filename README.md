  ## Description
  This is a fullstack application with a provided front end(starter code) for which i had to create a back end server and middleware for this application to be able to help a user take(create), save, update and delete a note or notes. I used Express.js framework and uniquid library for the unique ids for each note taken. This application helps users take notes whether in a meeting, school or wherever it is deemed necessary effortlessly by take, update read or even delete notes.
